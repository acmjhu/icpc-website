Campus Map: Contest registration will be held in Hackerman Hall. On the
[campus map](https://www.jhu.edu/assets/uploads/2014/10/homewood_campus_map.pdf),
Hackerman is Building 29. We suggest you park in the parking structure beneath
the Decker Quad.

## From I-95 (southbound) or from I-695 (the Baltimore Beltway)
{:.no_toc}
Take the beltway toward Towson to exit 25. Take Charles Street south for about
7 miles (when Charles Street splits a block after Loyola College and Cold
Spring Lane, take the right fork). As you approach the university and cross
University Parkway, continue southbound but be sure to jog right onto the
service road. After you pass the university on the right, turn right onto Art
Museum Drive. Just after the Baltimore Museum of Art, bear right at the traffic
island onto Wyman Park Drive. Take a right immediately after the university
gates into the parking structure.

## From I-95 (northbound)
{:.no_toc}
Take exit 53 onto I-395 north toward downtown Baltimore, then take the exit to
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and follow the directions from Martin Luther
King Junior Boulevard below.

## From Maryland 295 (the Baltimore-Washington Parkway)
{:.no_toc}
Entering Baltimore, the parkway becomes Russell Street. Stay on Russell Street
until (with the new Baltimore Ravens stadium to your right and Oriole Park at
Camden Yards looming before you) you reach the right-hand exit marked Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard (look carefully for this; the signs are small). This
exit will put you very briefly on a service road parallel to Russell Street.
Stay to the left and take the ramp marked Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
Follow the directions (below) from Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

## From Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
{:.no_toc}
Take King Boulevard north until it ends at Howard Street (remain in one of the
middle lanes of King Boulevard to avoid a premature forced right or left turn).
Turn left at Howard Street and proceed about 2 miles. One block past 29th
Street, turn left at the traffic island (just before the Baltimore Museum of
Art) onto Wyman Park Drive. Take a right immediately after the university gates
into the parking structure.

## From the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83) southbound
{:.no_toc}
Take the 28th Street exit to 28th Street east. Turn left on Howard Street. One
block past 29th Street, turn left at the traffic island (just before the
Baltimore Museum of Art) onto Wyman Park Drive. Take a right immediately after
the university gates into the parking structure.
